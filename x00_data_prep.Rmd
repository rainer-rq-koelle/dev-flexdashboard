PRU publishes open performance data on a monthly basis at ansperformance.eu.

```{r}
library(readxl)
# note: readxl does not yet support to read from url
# thus, we download the file first
tfc_xlsx <- "https://ansperformance.eu/download/xls/Airport_Traffic.xlsx"
tfc <- basename(tfc_xlsx)
download.file(url = tfc_xlsx, destfile = tfc
              , mode="wb"   # on Windows specify binary mode!
              )

df <- readxl::read_excel(tfc, sheet = "DATA")
```
