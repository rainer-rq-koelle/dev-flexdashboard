### Blurb

This example was shown as part of the talk Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny at the [Enterprise Applications of the R Language (EARL) conference in London, September 2018](https://earlconf.com/2018/london/#matt-dray).

> Self-service interactive tools have great power to support decisions by policy-makers. Shiny apps are a natural fit for this, but it's not always easy to share them within the public sector. This is due to issues like a lack of server space, highly sensitive data and users who aren't R-savvy.
>
>We've approached this problem in the UK's Department for Education by sharing interactive HTML widgets – embeddable JavaScript visualisation libraries – within RMarkdown outputs. Interactivity is, however, limited because selections in one widget don’t impact the data presented in another.
>
>[Joe Cheng's Crosstalk package](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) overcomes this with shared data objects that react to user inputs, altering the content of multiple widgets on the fly. I'll explain how I used Crosstalk to develop a 'pseudo-app' for exploring schools data with the Leaflet (maps), Plotly (charts) and DT (tables) widgets inside the Flexdashboard framework and how I shared it easily with policy-making users as a static HTML file for exploration in the browser.

### How to use

#### Filters

You can:

* select one or more local authorities from the dropdown menu (remove them with your backspace key)
* select one or more Ofsted grades using the checkboxes
* select the phase of education with the checkboxes
* drag the slider to select a pupil count
* drag the slider to filter by the percenatge of pupils receiving free school meals

#### Interactive map

You can:

* click to grab and drag the map around
* zoom with the '+' and '--' buttons (top-left) or with your mouse's scroll wheel
* click a marker to reveal a popup with information about that school
* click the button showing a broken square (top-left under the zoom options) to select points on the map using a window that's draggable (click and hold the grid icon in the upper left) and resizeable (click and drag the white boxes in each corner)

#### Interactive table

You can:

* filter each column by typing in the boxes under each column header
* sort the columns (ascending and descending) by clicking on the column header
* change which columns are visible by clicking the Column visibility button
* click 'CSV' or 'Excel' to download the filtered data to a .csv file or a .xlsx
* see how many entries remain after filtering in the bottom-left, where it says 'Showing X to Y of Z entries'

### Tools

[R v3.4.4](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio v1.1.442](https://www.rstudio.com/) were used to build this tool.

The packages used were:

* [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) to create a frame for the content
* [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for the interactive map
* [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) for the interactive table
* [Crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) for widget interactivity
* [Ion icons](https://ionicons.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
